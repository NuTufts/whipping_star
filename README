###################################################i#############################

This is a trimmed down version of SBNfit for usage in uBooNE. It does not have full functionality yet, things are being migrated in/checked and documentated. 

##########################################   Building and compiling  ########################################
The CMakeLists should be a standard and generic enough to work on most machines, although I have not tested it everywhere. It should also be simple enough to fix if it doesn't work out-of-the-box. 
For an introduction see: https://microboone-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/private/ShowDocument?docid=17092

Attention: Please see the github wiki for most up to date documentation  https://github.com/markrosslonergan/whipping_star/wiki

#Instructions for GPVM based building and running. While in base git directory
source .setup.sh 

#To Build, should work out of the box on GPVM with above setup
cd build
cmake ..
make

This will build the SBNfit source and libraries, as well as executable example programs in build/example
The included simple examples are not physically accurate, just toy MC! 

cd examples

#The first example builds a covariance matrix from eventweight std::map<std::string,std::vector<double>> objects
./example1 --xml example.xml --print

should have 4 output files, first two data, second two human readable plots
	EXAMPLE1.SBNspec.root	: The central value spectra
	EXAMPLE1.SBNcovar.root	: The full and fractional covariance matricies
	SBNfit_spectrum_plots_EXAMPLE1.root    : The central value plots, but subchannels stacked to represent a channel
	SBNfit_covariance_plots_EXAMPLE1.root  : The covariance matricies plotted as TH2D nicely. Inside directory individualDir is all the individual variation matricies

#The second example loads up the computed covariance matrix and makes a plot of the chi^2 as you scale the signal for stats and stats+sys
./example2 --xml example.xml

should have 1 output. EXAMPLE2_plots.root containing a simple TCanvas showing the chi^2 behaviour



####Steps for running on Tufts####
Scripts for running the MicroBooNE simulation on the Tufts cluster

Production workflow wiki: https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/uboone-physics-analysis/wiki/MCC9_Production_Fhicls

Steps

if not at Tufts, connect to Tufts VPN (using Cisco anyconnect)
ssh into the Tufts cluster: ssh -XY [username]@login.pax.tufts.edu
start an interactive job: srun --pty -p wongjiradlab --mem-per-cpu=4000 --cpus-per-task=2 --time 4:00:00 bash
go to some working directory in one of your folders on the wongjiradlabnu drive
setup to be able to use singularity: module load singularity/3.5.3
activate cvmfs remote drives: cvmfs_config probe fermilab.opensciencegrid.org uboone.opensciencegrid.org
can check you see them: ls /cvmfs/
start the SL7 container: singularity shell -B /cluster:/cluster,/cvmfs:/cvmfs /cluster/tufts/wongjiradlabnu/larbys/larbys-container/sl7_uboonecodedep.sif
start a bash shell in the container: bash
